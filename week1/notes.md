# welcome to intro to JavaScript

## a quick look at the exciting and often confusing world of JavaScript

### the many JavaScript engines

## homework
create accounts for the following (both are free)  
[github](https://github.com/)  
[cloud9](https://c9.io/)

### working from your own laptop

if you want to work from your own laptop and not use cloud9 you will need the
following tools:

#### text editor
it doesn't matter which text editor, anything that you can write plain text
with. That said here are a few that are pretty good.
[atom](https://atom.io/)
[sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
[vim](http://www.vim.org/)

#### node
[node](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
and a package manager for node:  
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) npm is installed with nodejs by default, if you
feel adventurous you can try [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

#### git
[git](https://git-scm.com/)

other tools will be discussed as we go, but having these three things installed
for the second class will allow you to follow along and work on the class labs.

#### windows users note

if you are using a laptop with a windows OS I will be using the bash terminal in
class and unix command-line commands. If you are not comfortable with working
with the command-line already I would strongly recommend that you use cloud9.

if you are using windows and would like to follow along you can use:  
[babun](http://babun.github.io/) or  
[cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)
