# todo list app local storage

last week you started working on creating the JavaScript for a simple todo list,
this week you are going to add localStorage to your todo list so that your list
persists when you close your browser.

in addition to the functionality discussed last week your app should now store
items locally so that you can close your browser, open it up again and still
have access to the list. This means that you need to account for the following:

- adding items to localStorage
- removing items from localStorage
- using any items stored in localStorage to populate your list when you re-load
the browser

don't just start coding, stop and write out all of the steps needed to make this
work, within the three points listed above are sub steps that you will need to
account for. for example what is the key you are going to use to retrieve a
todo? what data structure are you using to store your todos, an object, an array
of objects...?

write out what needs to be done, and how you might start to solve each problem.
after doing this you may wish to try to solve problems in pieces. use the
console and developer tools to test a smaller program that achieves some of the
functionality you are trying to add to your project.

## additional assignment guidelines.

- you may use a library to assist you with localStorage
- you may **not** use jQuery.

don't forget to check the first set of guidelines from last week.

your project should be hosted on github in a new repository and deployed to the
web using netlify or surge.  
your github repo should contain the following:

- README.md
    - this is just a very general description of the functionality and usage of
      the app
    - use proper markdown syntax.
- project.json
- app.js
- styles.css
- index.html

## deploy your app

you also need to deploy your app to either netlify or surge. follow the
instructions on either of their sites, both services are very easy to use but I
encourage you not to wait until the last minute.

**ask** any questions that you may have early, the night before class is too late.

## due date

this project is due at the start of next weeks class. you should have emailed me
a link to your github hosted repository and the link of your hosted app provided
by netlify or surge **before the start of class**.
