# final project part one

## the final project/take home exam

for your final project you are to create an app, anything that you want. you can
make a node app that runs in the terminal, or on a server, or a web app with an
html and css UI. Think about something that you want to make, something that
would be useful to you in someway. I also encourage you to consider a project
that you could expand upon later, something that you could use as a portfolio
piece after graduating.

I will provide you with more detail about the final project after looking over
the proposals.

## part one, what is due next week.

for next week I would like you to submit a project proposal. Roughly 3/4 of page
that describes the project you would like to make. This should include
functionality, platform, any additional technology that you intend to use.
This should also include a why, why are you making this? what problem does it
solve or how will it make some part of your life, or another persons life
better.

## what you may not do

you may not submit a project that you created in Kevin's HTML/CSS class with a
little JavaScript tacked on, JavaScript should be the focus of your project as
this is a JavaScript class.

if you wish to make something that we have worked on in class, like a todo list
or weather app you need to get my approval first.

you may not use jQuery.


## grading

if you are creating a UI in HTML and CSS some (although very minimal)
consideration will be given to the design of your app, so make use of what you
have learned in your other courses this term.

## due date

your final project(a project based take home exam) is due one week after the
last class, by noon of that day.

## due next week:

a 3/4 page proposal detailing the app that you would like to make.
