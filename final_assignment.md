# final assignment

You are to create a web app, anything that you want, within reason. As this is
your first project, I don't expect you to create the next Netflix, or an app to
end world hunger(although it would be awesome if you did this). This can be something simple to help you manage your time when studying,
or to manage your finances, or a library of your comics...

You need to send me an email and get approval of your project idea before you
begin working on this assignment. If you are having difficulty coming up with an
idea on your own, please speak with me.

If you wish to work in a group you need to get permission to do so.

You may use third party libraries (other than jQuery) look for packages that are
well documented and updated regularly.

**no jQuery**

**no personal websites with a little JavaScript tacked on**

## submission

minimum submission is the required files for me to test your code on github
your repository should include at least 1 JavaScript file.

if deployment with surge or netlify makes sense, please do that.  
other deployment talk to me first

everything I need to test this locally: HTML, CSS, package.json... depending on your project.

detailed instructions in your README.md on how to install and use your app.

## questions

as always ask questions early.
