# even more free online resources

The following list contains resources to help you learn more advanced topics,
very specific aspects of programming and also resources to help you stay
up-to-date with development trends. These resources are predominantly JavaScript
resources, but some are more general and one or two even contain some
information for the designers in the class.

## student recommended

if any former, current or future students have resources that they find helpful
and wish to share with other students, please forward them to me.
