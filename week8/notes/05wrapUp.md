# final thoughts

we have covered a lot today, but if we reduce to its simplest form we have looked at 3 really important things:

- how to select elements:
  - getElementById
  - getElementsByClassName
  - getElementsByTagName
  - querySelector
  - querySelectorAll

- how to create, append to elements
  - creatElement
  - textContent
  - appendToChild

- how to listen for an event:
  - addEventListener

there is a lot more that we can do with the DOM and we will be adding to
this list in the coming weeks, but this is a good start. 
I encourage you to look at the example tip calculator, re-read the notes
and try some of these new things out. When trying these make use of some of the
tools and techniques you already know, use NPM to create a new test project, use
a for loop with an HTML list, or create elements from an object...
