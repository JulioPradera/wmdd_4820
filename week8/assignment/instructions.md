## project guidelines

recreate the functionality demonstrated in the todo list app shown in class.
your todo list should be able to:

- create a new todo
- mark a todo as completed
- change a completed item back to incomplete, indicating that it is to be done still(again)
- have a delete button that allows you to delete a todo item.

you can alter the css or the html if you would like to as long as your todo list
app includes the demonstrated functionality.

## submission instructions

submit your app in a **new** git repository, your repository should include a
README.md, use proper markdown syntax for your README.md

your project should include:
- a package.json 
- make use of eslint(using the standard config). your package.json should include a script to lint your file with eslint.
your eslint can be configured in a separate config, or the package.json
- a .gitignore that tells git to ignore your node_modules directory.

## remember that this is part one of a two part assignment

I will give you the second part of this assignment next week, don't leave it until then to start working on it though.
I am doing this not to be mean to you, but because this is a very real part of software development, you start working on 
a project and later find out about additional functionality that you need to implement.

**don't wait until the last minute to start working on this and ask questions if you need help**
