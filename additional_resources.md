### vim

vim is the text editor that i use in class, a few students have asked about it
so for the curious here are a few places to learn a little more about vim.

[vim](http://www.vim.org/)  
vim tutorial:  
[a byte of vim](https://www.gitbook.com/book/swaroopch/byte-of-vim/details) this
covers vim version 7 and version 8 just came out, but the basics haven't
changed. if you are just getting started I would recommend sticking with sublime
text or atom for now, but vim is good to know if you think you will be mucking about
on a server in the future.
