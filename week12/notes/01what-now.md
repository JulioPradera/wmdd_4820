# what comes next

so you are almost finished this class and hopefully you have learned a lot about
JavaScript and programming for the web. Some of you may be wondering where to go
from here, what should you learn next? The possibilities are very broad but here
are a few resources that I hope will help you in continuing your studies.

## step one: write more JavaScript

write more JavaScript, and when you are done write more JavaScript still.

if you can't think of what to write, perhaps this will help:

## read more

videos are great, but often videos focus on the code and not the underlying
concepts. here are a few books that you may find helpful:

[grokking algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms)

## stop in to chat

you don't have a class with me in second term, but I am still around, you have
my email address and you know where my office is. feel free to drop in and ask
questions still.

## good luck!
