# labs for week 4

## lab one slice and splice

l1  
create a new array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

using slice create a new array with the values [3, 4, 5]

l2  
create a new array [1, 2, 3]

using splice add the string 'one' to the 0 position of your array.

using splice remove the 2 and 3 from your array.

now using splice change your array to match this ['cat', 'dog', 'owl']

## lab two loops

write a loop that displays the sum of all numbers between 0 and 100 that
are multiples of 3.

hint: n % 3 === 0

write a for loop that iterates over the numbers 1-20 and outputs even  
or odd for every value, like this:
    1: odd
    2: even
    3: odd

you will need to use an if else condition and console.log()

## lab three functions

write a function declaration that takes one parameter a number, and  
returns whether or not that number is a prime number. your function should
return a boolean

test if prime.
n === 1 false
n === 2 true
use a loop  to loop over the values from 2 to the number you are testing 
n % x === 0 false
