# currency converter app

create a simple app that allows a user to convert a price from one currency to
another.

if for example I wanted to see how much 80 Euros is in Canadian dollars I could
use this app to do this.

use the [fixer](http://fixer.io/) api

you must create the HTML and CSS for this app, keep it simple. you should have
some CSS styling but it can be minimal.

## app includes

a method to take two different currencies
a method to take an amount, a number

a way to store a default currency to localStorage. so if I always want to
convert from one country to Canadian dollars I can store Canadian dollars in
localStorage.

## hand in

push a repository to github that contains:

app.js
index.html
style.css
package.json

you should install eslint and use eslint to lint your code.
use standard with eslint and if your code is not linted marks will be deducted.

send me a link to your github repository

and a link to your app deployed to surge or netlify
