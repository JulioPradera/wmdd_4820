# fetch

fetch is a relatively new API for making network requests similar to XMLHttpRequest, with a
cleaner more modern API that uses JavaScript promises (you may want to read the
notes on promises before diving into actually trying fetch). you can also use
async await with fetch, but we are only going to look at promises today.

## fetch is new warning

fetch is still pretty new, and still a work in progress, it may not be included
in your browser if you are using IE. use Chrome or FireFox, a recent version.
