# destructuring rest and spread

in the location IQ example I used a rest parameter (...data) I haven't shown you
this syntax in class before as it a little more advanced and also another
relatively new feature of JavaScript. 

Understanding of destructuring will not be required to succeed in this class, the following resources are just for the
curious, and as always you can ask me if you have any questions.
